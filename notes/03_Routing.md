# Routing

## Routing in React

1 Install a third party package.  
2 Add routes.js file to configure the routes.  
3 For each route, create a component, export the component, import in routes.js and configure the new route with a path property.

## Routing in a Next.js app

- File-system based routing mechanism.
- When a file is added to the pages folder in a project, it automatically becomes available as a route
- By mixing and matching file names with a nested folder structure, it is possible to pretty much define the most common routing patterns.
