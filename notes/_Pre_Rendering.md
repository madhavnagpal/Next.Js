# Two forms of pre-rendering for Next.js.

## Static Generation (Recommended):

The HTML is generated at build time and will be reused on each request. To make a page use Static Generation, either export the page component, or export getStaticProps (and getStaticPaths if necessary). It's great for pages that can be pre-rendered ahead of a user's request. You can also use it with Client-side Rendering to bring in additional data.

## Server-side Rendering:

The HTML is generated on each request. To make a page use Server-side Rendering, export getServerSideProps. Because Server-side Rendering results in slower performance than Static Generation, use this only if absolutely necessary.
